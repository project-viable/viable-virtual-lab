1) Click on the light switch and turn microscope light on
2) Remove the cell slide from the sample fridge
3) Ensure the temperature of the fridge is between 32 and 42 degrees Celsius. Otherwise, cells will die. Only apply oil to the cell sample slide if viewing the cell image at the magnification level  100x. Applying it to the other magnifications can cause the image to deteriorate or the objective to be ruined.
4) Open the microscope's environmental chamber
5) Place the cell sample slide inside the microscope's environmental chamber
6) Close the microscope's environmental chamber
7) Click on the light switch and turn microscope light off
8) Click on the computer screen
9) In the opened window, click on the Viable logo. 
10) Click on the Focus wheel (left side to lower focus or right side to increase focus) to bring the cell image into focus
11) Select one of the four magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x, or 100x). 
12) Using the Joystick, navigate through the cell image.
13) Select one of the four channels (green, red, far-red, or combo). 
14) Adjust the LED power and the exposure time settings. Increasing the LED power or increasing the exposure time will make things brighter. Too high and the cells will start to photobleach or die, and the values will max out (making it hard to analyze later). Decreasing the LED power or decreasing the exposure time will make things dimmer. If it is too low, it will be hard to see, and the values will be too close to the values for the background or outside the cells (making it hard to analyze later). 
15) To switch out the cell slide, exit the microscope interface and computer window. Open the microscope's environmental chamber and remove the cell sample slide. Repeat steps 2-13.
