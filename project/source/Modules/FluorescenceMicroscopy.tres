1) Click on each of the sliding doors of the microscope to open them. They can be found at the top of the microscope.

2) Turn on the light for the microscope's environmental chamber by clicking the button found to the left of the chamber.

3) Open the fridge and make sure that the temperature is between 32 and 42 degrees Celsius otherwise, cells will die.

4) If you want to view the cell image at the magnification level 100x, apply the zoom oil to the sample. If not, continue to the next step. Applying the oil when using the other magnifications can cause the image to deteriorate or the objective to be ruined.

5) Remove the sample you want to view and drag it to the microscope chamber. Ensure the cell sample slide is oriented correctly or nothing but a black screen will be viewable. You can change the slide orientation by clicking on it.

6)Make sure the environmental chamber light is off and close the slides to the chamber.

7) Click on the computer screen

8) In the opened window, click on the Viable logo. 

9) Select one of the channels (Dapi, FITC, TRITC, Cy5, or Combo). 

10) Adjust the LED power and the exposure time settings. Increasing the LED power or increasing the exposure time will make things brighter. Too high and the cells will start to photobleach or die, and the values will max out (making it hard to analyze later). Decreasing the LED power or decreasing the exposure time will make things dimmer. If it is too low, it will be hard to see, and the values will be too close to the values for the background or outside the cells (making it hard to analyze later). 

11) Press the green play button to view the cell sample slide.

12) Click on the square-shaped Focus wheel (on the counter to the right of the computer screen). 

13)Turn the wheel left or right until the cell image is in focus. Turning left will lower the focus and turning right will inscrease the focus.

14) Select one of the four magnification levels (10x, 20x, 40x, or 100x). 

15) Click on the Joystick, found on the counter to the right of the computer screen.

16)Using the Joystick, navigate across the cell image by dragging from the center.

17) To switch out the cell slide, exit the microscope interface and computer window. Open the microscope's environmental chamber and remove the cell sample slide. Repeat steps 4-15.
