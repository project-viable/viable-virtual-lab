									      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
									      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
									      and conversions to other media types.

									      \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
									      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
									      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
									      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

									      \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
									      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
									      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
									      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
									      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
									      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
									      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

									      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including
									      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
									      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

									      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"

									      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
									      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
									      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

									   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
									      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
									      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
									      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
									      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
									      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

									   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
									      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
									      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
									      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
									      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

									      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
									      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
									      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
									      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
									      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
									      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
									      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
									      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
									      as of the date such litigation is filed.

									   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
									      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
									      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
									      meet the following conditions:

									      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
									          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

									      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
									          stating that You changed the files; and

									      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
									          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
									          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
									          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
									          the Derivative Works; and

									      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its
									          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
									          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
									          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
									          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
									          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
									          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
									          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
									          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
									          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
									          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
									          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
									          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
									          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
									          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
									          as modifying the License.

									      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
									      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
									      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
									      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
									      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
									      the conditions stated in this License.

									   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
									      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
									      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
									      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
									      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
									      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
									      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

									   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
									      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
									      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
									      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

									   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
									      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
									      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,
									      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
									      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
									      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
									      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
									      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
									      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

									   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
									      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
									      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
									      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
									      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
									      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
									      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
									      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
									      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
									      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
									      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

									   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
									      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
									      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
									      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
									      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
									      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
									      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
									      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
									      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
									      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

									   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

									   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

									      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
									      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"
									      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

									          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

									      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
									          stating that You changed the files; and

									      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
									          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
									          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
									          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
									          the Derivative Works; and

									      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its
									          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
									          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
									          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
									          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
									          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
									          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
									          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
									          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
									          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
									          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
									          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
									          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
									          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
									          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
									          as modifying the License.

									      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
									      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
									      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
									      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
									      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
									      the conditions stated in this License.

									   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
									      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
									      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
									      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
									      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
									      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
									      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

									   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
									      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
									      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
									      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

									   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
									      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
									      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,
									      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
									      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
									      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
									      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
									      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
									      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

									   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
									      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
									      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
									      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
									      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
									      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
									      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
									      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
									      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
									      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
									      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

									   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
									      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
									      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
									      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
									      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
									      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
									      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
									      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
									      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
									      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
