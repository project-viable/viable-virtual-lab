# VIABLE Virtual Lab

To try out our current demo, click [here](https://project-viable.github.io/viable-virtual-lab/export/VirtualLabExport.html). You can also follow the Setup instructions below to try it out locally.

This is very much an early demo, and it is being regularly updated.

## Setup

(NOTE: This is intended for running the project locally for testing or development. We only plan on doing actual release versions online.)

To run the project locally, you need to clone or download the repo from GitHub.

To try it out once you've got the project files, you'll need to go to Project/Tools and run the Godot Engine executable there. Once that pops up you'll have to import the project itself, which is in Project/Source. You should only need to import it once on the computer you're using. Once you've imported it, you can open the project. From there, you can run the game by hitting the play button in the upper right.
