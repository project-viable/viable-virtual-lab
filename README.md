# VIABLE Virtual Lab

To try out our current demo, click [here](https://project-viable.github.io/viable-virtual-lab/export/VirtualLabExport.html). You can also follow the Setup instructions below to try it out locally.

This is very much an early demo, and it is being regularly updated.

# Getting Started

This project is made using Godot 3.5 (the LTS version). You don't need to download that yourself because we include its exectuable here, to make sure everyone is using the right version and everything.

This Documentation assumes some basic familiarity with Godot. It has links to the Godot docs for things you might not have been exposed to before, but if you've never used it before you'll probably want to follow at least one basic tutorial.

Here's a link to the Godot 3.5 documentation (and if you google something related to Godot, *make sure you're on the documentation for **this version***):<br>
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/

## Setup

To start, you need to clone or download the repo from GitHub.

To try the game once you've got the project files, you'll need to go to Project/Tools and run the Godot Engine executable there. Once that pops up you'll have to import the project itself, which is in Project/Source. You should only need to import it once on the computer you're using. Once you've imported it, you can open the project. From there, you can run the game by hitting the play button in the upper right.
