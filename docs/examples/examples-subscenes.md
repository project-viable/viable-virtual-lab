### 1 - Basic Subscene

See Scenes/Objects/SubsceneManagerTest.tscn.

This object does not extend the SubsceneManager script, because it needs only the basic functionality. It has several children to demonstrate where they should be put in the scene tree. While this particular SubsceneManager is `draggable`, most probably will not be.

### 2 - Complex, Real World Subscene

See Scenes/Objects/GelMoldSubsceneManager.tscn.

This is the Gel Mold in the Gel Electrophoresis module.
