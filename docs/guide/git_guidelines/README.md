These Git guidelines were written in ConTeXt. Assuming you have ConTeXt installed, you can compile
it with the command

```sh
context main.mkxl
```

which will create the document `main.pdf`. For usability reasons, the PDF is included in this
repository; if changes are made to the `mkxl` file, then it should be recompiled, and the updated
PDF should also be committed.
