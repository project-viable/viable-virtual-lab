## Procedures

### [Gel Electrophoresis](/procedures/gel_electrophoresis)
 
 Gel electrophoresis is a commonly-used laboratory technique, used to identify and quantify nucleic acid molecules based on size. This technique is essential for any researchers interested in using genomic techniques to study biological systems. 
 The learning objectives of this module are for researchers to understand how to perform gel electrophoresis, how molecules are separated by size and charge during the process, and how to understand their procedure results.

### [Fluorescence Microscopy](/procedures/fluorescence_microscopy)
In recent years, microscopy has resurfaced as an important tool in the lab. Microscopy enables living biological systems to be viewed at sub-cellular scales. By combining this imaging technique with fluorescent labeling, individual organelles or molecules can be visualized, allowing greater insight into the workings of cells. 
The learning objectives of this module are for researchers to understand how to take clear images of live, in-focus cells, how LED power and exposure time relates to overall image brightness, and how to identify the necessary imaging parameters to collect an analyzable image for downstream use.
