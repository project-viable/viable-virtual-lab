#{h1:Measuring solids}#

Place a weigh boat on top of the scale and tare it by first zooming in on the scale with #{prompt:interact_inspect}# and then pressing the "tare" button. The screen on the scale should read "0 g".

The scoopula can then be used to transfer solids to the weigh boat, including agarose powder. While holding the scoopula, hover over a container and press #{prompt:interact_primary}# to scoop from it. Then move the scoopula to the weigh boat and press #{prompt:interact_secondary}# to pour out the contents of the scoopula.
