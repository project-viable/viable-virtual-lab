[font_size=18]To make the gel[/font_size]
[ol]
Use the scoopula, weigh boat, and scale to measure 1 g of agarose powder.
Use the graduated cylinder to measure 50 mL of TAE buffer, and add it to the same flask.
Microwave the flask for 1 minute.
Swirl the flask until the agarose is fully dissolved into the buffer.
Pour the gel solution from the flask into the gel mold, and place the gel comb into the gel mold.
Wait 20 minutes for the gel to cool. Once the gel is solid, remove the comb. If the comb is removed before the gel is fully cool, then the wells will collapse.

[font_size=18]To run the gel[/font_size]
[ol]
Put the gel mold with the gel into the rig.
Pour TAE buffer into the gel rig until it fully covers the gel. This is needed to allow an electric current to run through the gel.
Place a tip onto the pipette using the tip box.
Use the pipette to move a DNA sample from one of the microcentrifuge tubes into a well in the gel. Note that this [i]must[/i] be done after covering the gel in TAE buffer (see step 2), since adding the buffer after will cause the samples to be removed from the wells.
Drop the pipette tip into the waste bin.
Repeat steps 3-5 for all DNA samples, using a different well each time.
Hook up the color-coded positive and negative wires (red and black, respectively) to the power supply. Hook up the other ends of the wires to the gel rig.
Set the power supply to 120 volts and a running time of 20 minutes.
Press the start button on the power supply and wait 20 minutes for it to run.

[font_size=18]To image the gel[/font_size]
[ol]
Once the gel running has finished, remove the gel mold with the gel from the electrolysis setup and place it into the gel imager.
Press the button on the front of the imager to enable UV so that you can see the bands.
